## How to Launch the Interface

To start the interface, please follow these steps:

1. Open **RStudio**.
2. Locate and open the **mainPage.R** file within RStudio.
3. Run the **mainPage.R** file directly.

## Note on Layout and Tableau Public Embedding

When the interface runs, you may notice that the Tableau Public embedded charts appear misaligned or displayed in a vertical (top-to-bottom) arrangement instead of the intended layout. This is a known issue that sometimes occurs with Tableau Public embeds within RStudio.

### Solution
If the layout appears unsatisfactory or charts are not displayed as intended:
- **Refresh the page** to correct the alignment.

Thank you for using our interface!
